                <h2>About Snickers</h2>
                <p>Snickers is a candy bar made by Mars, Incorporated. It consists of a nougat center topped with
                    caramel and roasted peanuts, covered in milk chocolate. Snickers is one of the most popular candy
                    bars in the world and is sold in over 100 countries.</p>
                <p>One of the most famous advertising campaigns for Snickers is the "You're Not You When You're Hungry"
                    campaign, which features celebrities and athletes turning into different people when they're hungry
                    and then returning to their normal selves after eating a Snickers.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Snickers was first introduced in 1930 by Mars, Incorporated. It was named after the Mars family's
                    favorite horse, which was named after the family's favorite city, Snickersville, Virginia.</p>
                <p>The original Snickers bar was sold for five cents and was marketed as a meal replacement for people
                    who didn't have time for a full meal. In the 1940s, the nougat was changed from a whipped egg white
                    version to a firmer, more durable version made with milk and peanuts.</p>
